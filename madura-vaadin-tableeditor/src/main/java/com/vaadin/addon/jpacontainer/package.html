<P>This co-opts the com.vaadin.addon.jpacontainer because it uses the JPAContainer and it calls some protected methods.
These classes are not part of the official JPAContainer and not supported by Vaadin. Also note that to use the JPAContainer
in a commercial project you must buy a license from Vaadin (www.vaadin.com). This extension is, however, free (ie Apache 2 license).</P>
